This tutorial walks you through the steps of setting up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery workflow using Github actions. So we are going to build a simple Hello world app using React Native. We will then deploy that app to Expo through the workflow.

> _Continuous integration and Continuous Delivery are the processes in which development team delivers software in short cycles in the main branch while ensuring that it does not impact any changes made by other developers working on the same codebase._

### Prerequisites

* Expo and Github account
* Expo installed on either your Andriod or IOS device
* Expo CLI
* Android Emulator / IOS Simulator
